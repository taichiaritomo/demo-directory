      Encountered in isolation, the relaxing stimuli provided by <em>Jellyfish: Healing Kurage</em>—flowing music, soft lighting and colors, gentle movement, slow-paced editing, etc.—may not be sufficient to effectively and dependably produce the promised mood of “healing.” Through the repetition and overdetermination of similar affective cues in different aesthetic and sensory registers, however, a strong mood can be established even if audiences are only partially attentive to the on-screen drift. Once cultivated, <strong>a mood helps to steer future perceptual orientations</strong>, priming the brain to favor sensory cues reinforcing already established feelings.
